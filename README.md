## 🔧 Configuration
Update `src/app/config.ts` with your API Keys.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Install:** `npm install`
2.  **Run:** `npm start`

Based on the architecture of your application—which is a client-side Angular frontend connecting to a Firebase backend (Firestore, Auth)—you have several excellent options for deployment.

Since your application acts as a Single Page Application (SPA) where the "backend" logic is handled directly by Firebase services, you essentially only need to host the static files generated by your build process.

Here are the best places to deploy your application:

1. Firebase Hosting (Recommended)
This is the most logical choice because your application already relies on the Firebase ecosystem.

Why: It keeps your frontend and backend (Firestore/Auth) in the same Google Cloud project. It automatically configures SSL, provides a global CDN, and prevents Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues with your database.

## 🚀 How:
1. **Install the CLI:** npm install -g firebase-tools
2. **Login:** firebase login
3. **Initialize:** firebase init (Select Hosting, choose your existing ld-debate-judge project, and set your public directory to dist/ld-debate-judge/browser).
4. **Deploy:** ng build followed by firebase deploy.

## To add new files to git:
1. **Stage all changes: This command adds all modified, new, or deleted files in your working directory to the Git staging area, preparing them for a commit** git add -a
2. **Commit the changes: This command records the staged changes in your local repository with a descriptive message.** git commit -m "message"
3. **Push the changes to the remote repository: This uploads your local commits to the trunk branch on the remote repository (usually named origin).** git push origin main
